# Dross (In Rust ðŸ¦€)

A tool for expanding the power of your [exobrain](https://beepb00p.xyz/exobrain/) âš¡ðŸ§ 

## Getting Started

1. Follow the instructions for creating an [internal Notion integration here](https://www.notion.so/help/create-integrations-with-the-notion-api#create-an-internal-integration)
2. Connect the integration to the Notion Pages you want this CLI to have access to by following [this Notion guide](https://www.notion.so/help/add-and-manage-connections-with-the-api#add-connections-to-pages)
3. Run `cp .env.example .env` and fill in the env var values.
4. `cargo build`
5. `RUST_LOG=debug cargo run`
6. Profit!

## Helpful Tools

1. [notion-cli-rs](https://github.com/Melvillian/notion-cli-rs): useful for quickly fetching Notion data when you need to debug your exobrain.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Build a service for ingesting exobrain text (Notion, Obsidian, Apple Notes, etc.)
- [ ] Use RAG and LLM Prompting to periodically run a personalized retro for your life
- [ ] Expand memory powers using SRS on exobrain
- [ ] Use Dross to identify [The One Thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_Thing_(book)) to iterate on
- [ ] Learn from users what new exobrain powers they would like  
=======

## TODO

- [ ] Ingest latest 7 days of edited blocks from notion
- [ ] Write retro prompt
- [ ] Prompt retro with latest 7 days of exobrain data
- [ ] Build conversation datastructure so I can have a retro with my last 7 days of exobrain data
- [ ] Make more TODOs
- [ ] TODO: need to handle the case where I edit BlockA in PageA, and blockA references as a child BlockB in PageB which I also edited. This is a problem because it means our resulting PromptText will contain duplicate blocks (BlockA and BlockB). It's not the end of the world, but it's not ideal and at least a case for optimization via caching.
