# Dross (In Rust ðŸ¦€)

A tool for expanding the power of your [exobrain](https://beepb00p.xyz/exobrain/) âš¡ðŸ§ 

## TODO

- [ ] Ingest latest 7 days of edited blocks from notion
- [ ] Write retro prompt
- [ ] Prompt retro with latest 7 days of exobrain data
- [ ] Build conversation datastructure so I can have a retro with my last 7 days of exobrain data
- [ ] Make more TODOs
- [ ] TODO: need to handle the case where I edit BlockA in PageA, and blockA references as a child BlockB in PageB which I also edited. This is a problem because it means our resulting PromptText will contain duplicate blocks (BlockA and BlockB). It's not the end of the world, but it's not ideal and at least a case for optimization via caching.
